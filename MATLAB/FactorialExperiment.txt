Factors to investigate:
1. Thrust timing
2. Thrust output
3. Roll
4. Pitch
5. Yaw

States for each factor:
-1: Low
0:  Normal
1:  High

Number of Experiments needed:
3^5 = 243

 243 / 3  = 81
 81 / 3   = 27
 27 / 3   = 9
 9 / 3    = 3


index 122 - 81 = 41, 41 - 27 = 14, 14 - 9 = 5, 5 - 3 = 2
0 timing
0 output
0 everything!

index 21 - 18 = 3
-1 timing
-1 output
+1 roll
-1 Pitch
+1 Yaw
