Experiments Plan

31.10
Notes on work so far:
Effects of J2 and Thrust Dynamics seems to be far greater than effects of timing delay in HPOP simulation.
What can be done:
...Could make thrust acceleration more like an impulse thrust, but would be less representative of real-world scenario
...Could make timing delay greater to increase its effect on the result
...J2 even greater than Thrust Dynamics, this should probably be excluded from some simulations?
And _why_ is this a problem?
...It is a problem because the mean value of the deviation is almost only affected by the effects other than thrust delay
...The conclusion becomes: thrust delay is not the real problem

Experiment 1 setup:
Satellite starts in OrbitNTNU orbit. Rendezvous point should be chosen from actual debris data maybe???
