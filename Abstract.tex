\section{Abstract}

Uncertainties in orbit determination and the orbit uncertainties after applying rendezvous control strategies over a given time horizon for satellites has been investigated. Model assumptions, nonlinearities, and measurement uncertainties have been identified and quantified. \\

An orbit uncertainty model for the scenario of a chaser satellite rendezvousing a target object has been derived. The model is based on the parameters and thrusters of the XX satellite. Inputs to the model are: 1) The current orbit parameter observations and corresponding uncertainties of the chaser and target objects, and 2) The planned thruster firings of the chaser satellite. The model outputs the spatial and timing uncertainties of the final rendezvous between the chaser and target objects. \\

A MATLAB implementation of the proposed uncertainty model is given. Included in the report is an overview of relevant equations from orbital mechanics and statistics. \\
