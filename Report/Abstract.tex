This report covers a study investigating positioning uncertainties when applying orbital rendezvous maneuvers. Model assumptions, nonlinearities and measurement uncertainties were identified, and their contribution to the uncertainty of the final position was modeled. \\

The main result of the study is the development of a formation positioning uncertainty model for the scenario of multiple chaser satellites rendezvousing a target object. The model is based on the parameters of the XX satellite. The inputs to the model are: 1) The current orbit parameter observations and corresponding uncertainties of the chaser and target objects, and 2) The planned thruster firings of the chaser satellites. The model outputs the spatial and timing uncertainties of the final chaser formation. \\
