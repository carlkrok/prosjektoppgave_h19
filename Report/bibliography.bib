abstract = {<p>The definitive reference for space engineers on rendezvous and docking/berthing (RVD/B) related issues, this book answers key questions such as: How does the docking vehicle accurately approach the target spacecraft? What technology is needed aboard the spacecraft to perform automatic rendezvous and docking, and what systems are required by ground control to supervise this process? How can the proper functioning of all rendezvous-related equipment, systems and operations be verified before launch? The book provides an overview of the major issues governing approach and mating strategies, and system concepts for rendezvous and docking/berthing. These issues are described and explained such that aerospace engineers, students and even newcomers to the field can acquire a basic understanding of RVD/B. The author would like to extend his thanks to Dr Shufan Wu, GNC specialist and translator of the book's Chinese edition, for his help in the compilation of these important errata.</p>},
